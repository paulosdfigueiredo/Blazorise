    TransferList: single item selection restored
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    A regression had caused <Strong>TransferList</Strong> items to become unselectable in single-selection mode. We've corrected this behavior so you can once again select and move individual items as expected. Multi-selection and drag-drop workflows remain unaffected.

    Table: prevent event bubbling and excessive SignalR traffic
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
    We've addressed a critical issue where unused mouse events inside the <Strong>Table</Strong> component could bubble up and flood <Strong>SignalR</Strong> on <Strong>Blazor Server</Strong>. The fix prevents unnecessary event propagation, reducing noise and improving responsiveness for data-heavy applications.
